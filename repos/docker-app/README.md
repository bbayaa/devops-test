# Docker App
Ideally, this would be its own repository, and it would be versioned/tagged with every release.
In this way, application-development teams can leverage it and reference newer versions when they are ready.

This "repository" just containerizes the Heal app, so that it can be referenced from the EKS cluster provisioned by Terraform.
